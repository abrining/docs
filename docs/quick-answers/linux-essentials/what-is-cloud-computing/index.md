title: What is Cloud Computing?
---

The versatility of cloud computing surpasses nearly anything you can do on a computer sitting right in front of you-be it in terms of speed, scale, or capacity. This makes cloud computing ideal for scenarios such as hosting websites, solving computational problems, and analyzing and storing large quantities of data.

You can choose a plan that works best for you and expand or reduce it as needed. The hardware costs and time spent maintaining the hardware and operating systems are offloaded to the cloud provider-you only need to worry about your application.


## Why Use Cloud Computing?

It's not uncommon for a startups and small businesses to host their website or application on-premises. This often means on an spare computer in a basement or closet. When the company outgrows that home server, and the residential internet connection it's connected to, they find that the cloud offers a massive boost in performance and resiliency, without expensive hardware and ISP bandwidth costs.

## Cloud Computing Models

Cloud is divided up into three models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

**SaaS**

Software as a Service is one or more applications that run on a cloud-based server. Netflix, Google Office, and iCloud are examples of Software as a Service.

**PaaS**

Platform as a Service is the underlying development and/or runtime stack that software services (such as those above) are built on. Examples would be web servers, development frameworks, and container or specialized virtual machine environments.

**IaaS**

Infrastructure as a Service means you rent the network and server resources from a provider for your own use; Linode is an example of IaaS. On this you can create PaaS and/or SaaS solutions, but IaaS is the most foundational model of Cloud Computing.

## Public and Private Clouds

Independent of the service model is the level of accessibility. This comes in three main flavors:

**Public Cloud**

Accessible to anyone. An IaaS or PaaS will start here, and the provider's customers can create their own private cloud if needed. Linode is an example of a public cloud provider.

**Private Cloud**

Access is restricted; inaccessible to the general public. A virtual private network is one example.

**Hybrid Cloud**

A combination of private and public resources. For example, an IaaS provider has their public website and management console, but they also have private resources such as software repositories and a customer database-things that are not accessible outside of the company.
